# afrie's note about homelabbing

`notes` are best viewed in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), `config` is fine on github/vscode. 

### why?
the notes are for me so that i dont forget what i've done/encountered/solve. it's in public if anyone find it useful. it's also an ego booster haha.

i'm learning as i go, lately i really enjoyed learning and writing at the same time, felt really productive and feels like i learned a lot.
